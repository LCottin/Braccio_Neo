# Braccio_Neo

This repository is the next part of the project 'Bras_robot'.
The goal here is to recreate the robot arm from scratch using dynamixel motors controled by a raspberry pi. In order to do so, we use the SDK to create our own library.

The arm will be built with : \
    - MX106T    : base \
    - MX106T    : shoulder \
    - MX64AT    : elbow \
    - MX28AT    : wrist_ver \
    - AX18A     : wrist_rot \
    - AX18A     : gripper 

The folder src contains each class used for the robot.
The folder PCB contains PCB we made for the project.
