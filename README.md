# Braccio_Neo

This repository is the next part of the project 'Bras_robot'.
The goal here is to recreate the robot arm from scratch using dynamixel motors controled by a raspberry pi. In order to do so, we use the SDK to create our own library.

The arm will be built with :
    - MX106     : shoulder
    - MX64AT    : elbow
    - MX28AT    : wrist_ver
    - AX18A     : wrist_rot
    - ???       : gripper

The folder src contains each class used for the robot.
